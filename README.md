## Multidrug resistant _Enterobacter bugandensis_ gains genomic, functional and metabolic advantages for thriving in International Space Station


A detailed scripts and procedures are given in the [Wiki]([https://github.com/MetaSUB-CAMP](https://github.com/RamanLab/ISS_Enterobacter/wiki)) page

Our analysis is distributed into three major parts
1. Comparative genomics of _Enterobacter bugandensis_ between ISS and Earth-bound strains to show their genomics and functional distinctiveness
2. Comprehensive analysis of metagenomics data to estimate the abundance of _E. bugandensis_ in the ISS and identify their co-occurring microorganisms
3. Explore the metabolic interactions of the _E. bugandensis_ in the ISS communities


Here we have the overview of our workflow
